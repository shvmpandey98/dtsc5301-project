# dtsc5301-project
Final project for DTSC 5301 where we are trying to explore on Energy consumption and its trend!!

Before the analysis, we posed two questions.

1. How has global per capita energy consumption changed over time? 
2. How does the renewable vs. non-renewable makeup of this energy consumption compare? 

Based on the Data Visualizations created we have observed the following,

1. The global per capita energy consumption has seen a drastic increase over the decade and its trajectory has been influenced by various factors, including technological advancements, economic development, population growth, and shifts in energy sources. Due the these advancements, the demand for energy has seen steady growth with no room for slowing down as of yet. Energy consumption will always increase amongst a civilization as we strive to move forward. this is fueled by our desire to improve our lives and make the right changes to increase the quality of life.

2. Up until 1990, the amount of total energy utilized per person remained basically constant. Since 1990, the average person's energy usage has been rising at a 7%-per-decade rate. The proportion of renewable energy, on the other hand, has been rising relatively flatly at a pace of about 1% every decade with Asia seeing the most growth in its energy consumption when compared to the rest of the regions. This increase in demand has only encountered 1 major issue which is which energy source is utilized. This debates for the fight between renewable and Non-renewable energy sources

3. The rise of renewable sources of energy and the environmental movement has made the consumers more Eco-friendly. Efforts to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are driving the global transition toward a greater reliance on renewable energy sources. However, the pace and success of this transition depend on numerous factors, including political will, economic considerations, and technological advancements. In some countries and regions, the transition to renewables has been more pronounced, with a growing percentage of electricity coming from wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. the OPEC countries have not yet reached Sustainability therefore they rely more on non-renewable sources of energy. this is caused due to a lack of knowledge and awareness which in turn causes harm to both the environment and the consumers. The most amount of growth in the renewable energy sector has been observed in the region of the US & Canada with an average of 2% growth per decade with Europe being the next biggest region to increase its growth by 3% per-decade.
